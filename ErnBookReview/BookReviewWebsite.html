The novel is narrated by Scout, offering a unique perspective as she recalls her childhood experiences with her father, Atticus Finch, a lawyer defending a Black man, Tom Robinson, falsely accused of raping a white woman.</p>
                <p>The novel's portrayal of justice, morality, and empathy has made it a timeless classic, inviting readers to reflect on the ways in which we confront our own biases and the extent to which we are willing to stand against societal wrongs. Through its richly developed characters and powerful themes, To Kill a Mockingbird continues to resonate with readers, offering a profound commentary on the human condition and the persistent struggles against inequality and discrimination.</p>
                <p>The character of Boo Radley, a reclusive neighbor, adds another layer to the story, representing how society often misconstrues and alienates those who are different or misunderstood. Lee's writing is compelling and evocative, drawing readers into the social dynamics of a small Southern town while making broader statements about humanity's capacity for both good and evil.</p>
